## Reporting issues

Please report any bugs or suggestions by opening a [github
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/mantis/issues).

If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug
with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex). See the
tidyverse guide on [how to create a great
issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.

## Development guidelines

If you’d like to contribute changes please raise an issue first, to make
sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.

### Pull request process

- Fork the package and clone onto your computer.

- Install all development dependencies with
  `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes
  R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. If R CMD check doesn’t
  pass cleanly, it’s a good idea to ask for help before continuing.

- Create a Git branch for your changes, with a brief but relevant name.

- Make your changes, add/update any appropriate unit tests, update any
  documentation, and make sure R CMD check passes.

- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md`
  (i.e. just below the first header).

- Commit and push your changes, then create a PR. The title of your PR
  should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain
  `Fixes #issue-number`.

### Code style

New code should follow the tidyverse [style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). We use
[Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to apply this style, but please
don’t restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.

We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown
syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html),
for documentation.

We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit
tests.

## Code of Conduct
