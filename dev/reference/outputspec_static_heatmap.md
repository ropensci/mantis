# Specify output options for a static report containing heatmaps

Each tab contains a heatmap with one row per time series.

## Usage

``` r
outputspec_static_heatmap(
  fill_colour = "blue",
  y_label = NULL,
  item_order = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- fill_colour:

  colour to use for the tiles. Passed to `high` parameter of
  [`ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html)

- y_label:

  string for y-axis label. Optional. If `NULL`, the label will be
  constructed from the
  [`inputspec()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/dev/reference/inputspec.md)

- item_order:

  named list corresponding to `item_cols` columns for ordering the items
  in the output. List values are either `TRUE` for ascending order, or a
  character vector of values contained in the named column for explicit
  ordering. If `item_order = NULL`, the original order will be kept. See
  Details.

## Value

An `outputspec()` object

## Details

For `item_order`, the names of the list members should correspond to the
column names in the `df`. Any names that don't match will be ignored.
When multiple columns are specified, they are sorted together, in the
same priority order as the list. If a list item is `TRUE` then that
column is sorted in ascending order. If a list item is a character
vector then that column is sorted in the order of the vector first, with
any remaining values included alphabetically at the end. If you want to
order the tabs, it is recommended to put the `tab_col` as the first item
in the list.

## Examples

``` r
# Customise the plot
outspec <- outputspec_static_heatmap(
  fill_colour = "#56B1F7",
  y_label = "Daily records"
)

# Sort alphabetically by Antibiotic
outspec <- outputspec_static_heatmap(
  item_order = list("Antibiotic" = TRUE)
)

# Sort alphabetically by Location first,
# then put "Vancomycin" and "Linezolid" before other antibiotics
outspec <- outputspec_static_heatmap(
  item_order = list("Location" = TRUE,
                    "Antibiotic" = c("Vancomycin", "Linezolid"))
)
```
