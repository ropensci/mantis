# mantis: Multiple Time Series Scanner

Generate interactive html reports that enable quick visual review of
multiple related time series stored in a data frame. For static
datasets, this can help to identify any temporal artefacts that may
affect the validity of subsequent analyses. For live data feeds,
regularly scheduled reports can help to pro-actively identify data feed
problems or unexpected trends that may require action. The reports are
self-contained and shareable without a web server.
