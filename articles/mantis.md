# Get started with mantis

This vignette demonstrates how to use this package to generate different
types of html reports that allow you to visually review multiple related
time series quickly and easily.

## Data format

The data frame containing the time series should be in long format, with
the following columns (though the actual column names can be different):

- one “timepoint” (date/posixt) column which will be used for the
  x-axes. Values should follow a regular pattern, e.g. daily or monthly,
  but do not have to be consecutive.
- one or more “item” (character) columns containing categorical values
  identifying distinct time series.
- one “value” (numeric) column containing the time series values which
  will be used for the y-axes.

**Example:**

The `example_prescription_numbers` dataset is provided with this
package, and contains (synthetic) examples of aggregate numbers of
antibiotic prescriptions given in a hospital over a period of a year. It
contains 5 columns:

- PrescriptionDate - The date the prescriptions were written
- Antibiotic - The name of the antibiotic prescribed
- Spectrum - The spectrum of activity of the antibiotic. This value is
  always the same for a particular antibiotic
- NumberOfPrescriptions - The number of prescriptions written for this
  antibiotic on this day
- Location - The hospital site where the prescription was written

``` r
# first, attach the package if you haven't already
library(mantis)

# this example data frame contains numbers of antibiotic prescriptions
# in long format
data("example_prescription_numbers")

head(example_prescription_numbers)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>   PrescriptionDate Antibiotic    Spectrum NumberOfPrescriptions Location
#>   <date>           <chr>         <chr>                    <dbl> <chr>   
#> 1 2022-01-01       Coamoxiclav   Broad                       45 SITE1   
#> 2 2022-01-01       Gentamicin    Broad                       34 SITE1   
#> 3 2022-01-01       Ceftriaxone   Broad                       36 SITE1   
#> 4 2022-01-01       Metronidazole Limited                     17 SITE1   
#> 5 2022-01-01       Meropenem     Broad                       10 SITE1   
#> 6 2022-01-01       Vancomycin    Limited                      0 SITE1
```

### Specifying the data columns

You must specify which column(s) in the supplied data frame should be
used to identify the individual time series (items), and which columns
contain the timepoint (x-axis) and value (y-axis) for the time series.
These are set using the `item_cols`, `timepoint_col` and `value_col`
parameters of
[`inputspec()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/inputspec.md)
respectively. Any other columns in the data frame are ignored.

Optionally, if there are multiple columns specified in `item_cols`, one
of them can be used to group the time series into different tabs on the
report, by using the `tab_col` parameter.

Members of `item_cols` should be specified in the order that you want
them to appear in the output.

**Example:**

For the `example_prescription_numbers` dataset above, the combination of
“Antibiotic” and “Location” columns uniquely identify a time series in
the data frame, and so both columns must be included in `item_cols`.

The “Spectrum” column can also be added to `item_cols` as well if
desired, in which case it will appear in the output as an additional
column/label. Otherwise it will be ignored.

Here are some options for specifying the data columns, depending on how
you want the report to look:

``` r

# create a flat report, and include the "Location" and "Antibiotic" fields
# in the content
inspec_flat <- inputspec(
  timepoint_col = "PrescriptionDate",
  item_cols = c("Location", "Antibiotic"),
  value_col = "NumberOfPrescriptions",
  timepoint_unit = "day"
)

# create a flat report, and include the "Location", "Spectrum", and "Antibiotic"
# fields in the content
inspec_flat2 <- inputspec(
  timepoint_col = "PrescriptionDate",
  item_cols = c("Location", "Spectrum", "Antibiotic"),
  value_col = "NumberOfPrescriptions",
  timepoint_unit = "day"
)

# create a tabbed report, with a separate tab for each unique value of
# "Location", and include just the "Antibiotic" field in the content of each tab
inspec_tabbed <- inputspec(
  timepoint_col = "PrescriptionDate",
  item_cols = c("Antibiotic", "Location"),
  value_col = "NumberOfPrescriptions",
  tab_col = "Location",
  timepoint_unit = "day"
)

# create a tabbed report, with a separate tab for each unique value of
# "Location", and include the "Antibiotic" and "Spectrum" fields in the content
# of each tab
inspec_tabbed2 <- inputspec(
  timepoint_col = "PrescriptionDate",
  item_cols = c("Antibiotic", "Spectrum", "Location"),
  value_col = "NumberOfPrescriptions",
  tab_col = "Location",
  timepoint_unit = "day"
)

# create a tabbed report, with a separate tab for each unique value of
# "Antibiotic", and include just the "Location" field in the content of each tab
inspec_tabbed3 <- inputspec(
  timepoint_col = "PrescriptionDate",
  item_cols = c("Antibiotic", "Location"),
  value_col = "NumberOfPrescriptions",
  tab_col = "Antibiotic",
  timepoint_unit = "day"
)
```

### Specifying the timepoint unit

In this example dataset, the time series contain daily values, which is
the default pattern of timepoints expected by the package. If the time
series were to contain e.g. monthly or hourly values, this should be
specified using the `timepoint_unit` parameter of
[`inputspec()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/inputspec.md).

## Generating a report

The simplest way to create a report is to use the
[`mantis_report()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/mantis_report.md)
function.

We need to decide where to save the report to. The file name can only
contain alphanumeric, `-` and `_` characters, and should include the
extension “.html”. If a path is supplied, the directory should already
exist. We can also optionally specify a short description for the
dataset, which will appear on the report.

There are 3 different options for visualising the time series. This is
set using the `outputspec` parameter.

### Interactive plots

This is the default visualisation, and produces a table with one time
series in each row, with orderable and filterable columns showing the
previously-specified `item_cols` for identifying the time series. Also
in the table are the maximum value of each time series, and bar plots
with adjustable axes and tooltips showing the individual dates and
values.

There are some options for adjusting the output, such as changing column
labels, plot type, and whether or not to use the same y-axis scale
across the table. This can be done using the
[`outputspec_interactive()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/outputspec_interactive.md)
function when supplying the `outputspec` parameter.

**Example:**

For the `example_prescription_numbers` dataset above, we will save a
report in the working directory, with separate tabs for each hospital
site.

``` r
mantis_report(
  df = example_prescription_numbers,
  file = "example_prescription_numbers_interactive.html",
  inputspec = inspec_tabbed2,
  outputspec = outputspec_interactive(),
  report_title = "mantis report",
  dataset_description = "Antibiotic prescriptions by site",
  show_progress = TRUE
)
```

### Static plots

Alternatively, the report can output static plots. This can be useful if
interactivity is not needed, or if file sizes need to be kept small.
There are currently two types of static visualisations: heatmap or
multipanel, and are selected by using the
[`outputspec_static_heatmap()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/outputspec_static_heatmap.md)
or
[`outputspec_static_multipanel()`](https://ropensci.github.io/mantis/reference/outputspec_static_multipanel.md)
function when supplying the `outputspec` parameter.

#### Heatmap

``` r
mantis_report(
  df = example_prescription_numbers,
  file = "example_prescription_numbers_heatmap.html",
  inputspec = inspec_tabbed,
  outputspec = outputspec_static_heatmap(),
  report_title = "mantis report",
  dataset_description = "Antibiotic prescriptions by site",
  show_progress = TRUE
)
```

![](../reference/figures/example_prescription_numbers_heatmap.png)

#### Multipanel

``` r
mantis_report(
  df = example_prescription_numbers,
  file = "example_prescription_numbers_multipanel.html",
  inputspec = inspec_tabbed,
  outputspec = outputspec_static_multipanel(),
  report_title = "mantis report",
  dataset_description = "Antibiotic prescriptions by site",
  show_progress = TRUE
)
```
